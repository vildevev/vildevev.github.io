<h2>When asked to define happiness people often seem uncertain of its exact definition. We usually divide the common definition like this:</h2>
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Definition 1</th>
		<th>Definition 2</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>A feeling or sensation</td>
		<td>A conscious decision</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h3>Understanding this can be helpful for many because:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>They can understand how to become happier</li>
	<li>They'll acknowledge that its only a sensation and don't lean too heavily on it</li>
</ul>
