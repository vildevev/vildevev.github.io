<h1><b>What is happiness?</b></h1>

<img src="vildevev.github.io/happy.jpg" alt="happiness" />
<h2>When asked to define happiness people often seem uncertain of its exact definition. We usually divide the common definition like this:</h2>
<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Fiction</th>
		<th>Fact</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>A feeling or sensation</td>
		<td>A conscious decision</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<aside>What is your understanding of happiness? Do you agree with these definitions?</aside>
<h3>Understanding this can be helpful for many because:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>They can understand how to become happier</li>
	<li>They'll acknowledge that its only a sensation and don't lean too heavily on it</li>
</ul>

<h4>It is a good site. Nice pictures and high quality content. I recongnize the "header"-elements. My guess is that most of the unfamiliar elementsa re different fonts and styles: "Oui footer" for example, or the style called "$0".</h4>
